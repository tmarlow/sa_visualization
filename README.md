This is the R code to create a shiny app visualizing spatial autocorrelation. I've been using different versions of this app for the past two years while teaching a seminar on introduction to spatial statistics as a part of the [S4 GIS Institute](https://www.brown.edu/academics/spatial-structures-in-social-sciences/gis-institute).

You can view the app at the shiny server https://thomas-marlow.shinyapps.io/sa_visualization/ .

For a quick write-up on the app, see my blog.
