This is the R code to create a shiny app that visualizes spatial autocorrelation. I've been using different versions of this app for the past two years while teaching an afternoon seminar on introduction to spatial statistics as a part of the [S4 GIS Institute](https://www.brown.edu/academics/spatial-structures-in-social-sciences/gis-institute).
