        Spatial autocorrelation (SA) is the correlation of values in a single variable as a result of
        geographic proximity. The result is neighbors sharing similar values. SA is often measured
        as a correlation coefficient that ranges from -1 to +1. Negative SA is the non-random
        separation of similar values (e.g. a checkerboard pattern). Positive SA results in the spatial clustering
        of similar values."),

        Spatial autocorrelation also has a distance across works.
      This distance is highly context specific (social distance â‰  physical distance) and we must take care to think
      hard about which types of distance matter and explore how our decisions impact the results. 
      In many situations, contiguity of areal units is a reasonable approximation of the spatial structure of the data.
